# 100-days-of-code
During the next 100 days I will focus on improving my frontend skills through building several single page sites using React and several web services, learning new CSS animation and design skills, and working towards building a portfolio website as well as two larger projects.

## Completed project:
- [100daysofcodeblog](https://adriaanb.herokuapp.com/)


## Day1 - Design and deploy blog

...and we're off.

Today started off a bit slowly with me fumbling through attempts to create a blog as quickly as I can. Tried github pages with Jekyll, but I didn't want to install Ruby. Tried Gatsby, but I'm not proficient enough with react yet and attempting to modifying themes was tedious. Last chance to pull it off, go back to what you know. I built this simple page using Django, HTML and CSS. Attempted deployment, but I need to sort out some Heroku authentication issues. Will finish tomorrow

Tomorrow, I will also work on fetching blog posts from github using the github api, maybe try add some finess to the page. I am not looking to make this site too complex. I just want a place to share my thoughts and document my journey.

## Day2 - Deployed website and linked github

Today I finally managed the deploy as Heroku had changed some authentication issues. I also worked on a post about the intitial Django to deploy steps. I managed to create a quick javascript fucntion to fetch commits to this document and display them as posts on the blog. Using the django backend would have been easier but I want every blog to show on my github activity. This method allows me to do that. Here is a link to the blog https://adriaanb.herokuapp.com/.
